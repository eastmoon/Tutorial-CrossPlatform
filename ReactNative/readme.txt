React Native enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about — learn once, write anywhere.

React Native 使你建置世界級應用程式其體驗如原生平台，並使用JavaScript與React一貫以來的開發經驗。
React Native 專注於跨平台時的開發效率問題，學一技術用多處。

React native is not 『write once, run anywhere』.  This is 『Learn once, write anywhere』.

Xcode 7.0 or higher is required. It can be installed from the App Store.

To write React Native apps for Android, you will need to install the Android SDK (and an Android emulator if you want to work on your app without having to use a physical device). See Android setup guide for instructions on how to set up your Android environment.
